This project originated out of curiosity as a way to see if my preferences for my classes are self-consistent. I implemented it largely using code I had already written for a separate project that used Z3 to solve for a topological order of a list of sources for linguistic data given some partial rankings between subsets of them. 

However in a philosophy class we talked about how some value theorists think that preferences can be incomplete (in the sense that given three classes a, b, c, I prefer b to c but have no preference with a to c or a to b). This struck me as odd, and none of the examples in class were immediately convincing to me. So I extended this project to see if my preferences for classes are incomplete (verdict: it seems they are).
