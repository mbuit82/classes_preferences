This project originated out of curiosity as a way to see if my preferences for my classes are self-consistent. This was pretty easy to do since I had already implemented a solver that would do basically this for another project using Z3. However in a class we talked about how some value theorists think that preferences can be incomplete (in the sense that given three classes a, b, c, I prefer b to c but have no preference with a to c or a to b), so I thought I'd extend it to see if my preferences for classes are incomplete (so far it seems they are).
